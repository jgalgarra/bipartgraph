    "text": "This application provides an interactive environment to visualize bipartite ecological networks using the properties of k-core decomposition. Code is available under a MIT license at Github.\nBipartite networks are usually plotted using the bipartite plot or the interaction matrix. They work nicely with a small number of nodes and links but can become pretty messy for mid-sized networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutualistic community in Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain), with 68 species and 129 links [ L. Stald, A. Valido, and J. Olesen, Struktur og dynamik i rum og tid at et bestøvningsnetværk pA tenerife, de kanariske øer, Master, thesis, University of Aarhus, Denmark, 2003]. In mutualism, species fall into two disjoint guilds, such as plants and pollinators or plants and seed dispersers. Ties amongst species of the same guild are forbidden. (a) Bipartite plot of this community. (b) Interaction matrix.\n\nBipartGraph works with four type of plots: bipartite, matrix, ziggurat and polar. The bipartite plot offers three variants. Legacy is the classical depiction of a bipartite network, with nodes of both guilds ordered by descending degree.\n\n\nLegacy bipartite plot of the same mutualistic community.\n\nUsing the k-core decomposition properties, BipartGraph offers two original kinds of bipartite plot, kcore ordered and chilopod plots. This second one, provides a more compact and insightful graph by information reduction where specialist nodes are packed together.\n\n\nChilopod bipartite plot of the example community.\n\nThe ziggurat plot works by splitting both guilds in groups of k-shells, and distributes them in an almond-like shape to improve readability. This diagram makes easier to spot central and peripheral nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZiggurat plot of the same mutualistic community.\n\nThe polar plot uses the same decomposition to reduce information. Nodes are depicted at a distance proportional to the shell they belong to and their areas are proportional to their degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZiggurat plot of the same mutualistic community.\n\nBipartgraph is an interactive web application, for network exploration and reporting, and allows to produce high resolution files for journal publication.\nThe User Guide provides a full description:\nUser Guide\nIf you find it useful for your research and please include the following citation:\nJ.
